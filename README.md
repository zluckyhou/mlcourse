## Topic3 Decision Tree

### Information Gain

Shannon's entropy 
```
S = -\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_i*log_2^{p_i}

```

```
IG = S_0- \sum_(i=1)^_q\frac{N_i}{N}S_i

```
the process of finding the optimal feature and threshold
```
for loop:
	for each feature:
		caculate the IG
	find the optimal feature and threshold

```
